1.  Introduction

   Today, there is no widely accepted way of transferring digital
   credentials securely between two digital wallets independent of
   hardware and software manufacturer.  This document describes the
   problem space and the requirements for the solution the working group
   creates.

   Tigress allows for a sender and receiver to communicate in order to
   facilitate a secure credential transfer between two digital wallets.
   Tigress also specifies certain privacy requirements in order to
   maintain a high level of user privacy.

2.  General Setting

   When sharing digital secure credentials, there are several actors
   involved.  While the Tigress working group's solution will focus on
   sharing information between two digital wallets, potentially through
   an intermediary server, there are a couple more actors involved.

   The companies that are providing the digital credential for
   consumption by a digital wallet are the provisioning partners.  They
   are in control of the provisioning information and the lifecycle of
   the credentials.  Each digital wallet has a preexisting trust
   relationship between itself and the Provisioning Entity.

   The interface between the devices and the Provisioning Entity can be
   proprietary or a part of published specifications such as the
   [CCC-Digital-Key-30].  The sender obtains provisioning information
   from the provisioning partner, then shares it to the recipient via
   Tigress.  The recipient then takes that data and sends it to the
   Provisioning Entity to redeem a credential for consumption in a
   digital wallet.

   For some credential types the Provisioning Entity who mints new
   credentials is actually the sender.  In that scenario the receiver
   will generate a new key material at the request of the sender, and
   then communicate with the sender over Tigress to have its key
   material signed by the sender.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   General terms:

   *  Credential information - data used to authenticate the user with
      an access point.

   *  Provisioning information - data transferred from Sender to
      Receiver device that is both necessary and sufficient for the
      Receiver to request a new credential from Provisioning Entity to
      provision it to the Receiver device.

   *  Provisioning - A process of adding a new credential to the device.

   *  Provisioning Entity - an entity which facilitates Credential
      Information lifecycle on a device.  Lifecycle may include
      provisioning of credential, credential termination, credential
      update.

   *  Sender (device) - a device initiating a transfer of Provisioning
      Information to a Receiver that can provision this credential.

   *  Receiver (device) - a device that receives Provisioning
      Information and uses it to provision a new credential.

   *  Intermediary (server) - an intermediary server that provides a
      standardized and platform-independent way of transferring
      provisioning information between Sender and Receiver devices.

   *  Digital Wallet - A device, service, and/or software that
      faciliates transactions either online or in-person via a
      technology like NFC.  Digital Wallet's typically support payments,
      drivers licenses, loyalty cards, access credentials and more.

4.  Use Cases

   *  Let's say Ben owns a vehicle that supports digital keys which
      comply with the CCC specification [CCC-Digital-Key-30].  Ben would
      like to let Ryan borrow the car for the weekend.  Ryan and Ben are
      using two different mobile phones with different operating
      systems.  In order for Ben to share his digital car key to Ryan
      for a weekend, he must transfer some data to the receiver device.
      The data structure shared between the two participants is defined
      in the [CCC-Digital-Key-30].  In addition, the
      [CCC-Digital-Key-30] requires the receiver to generate required
      key material and return it to the sender to sign and return back
      to the receiver.  At this point, the receiver now has a token that
      will allow them to provision their new key with the car.

   *  Bob booked a room at a hotel for the weekend, but will be arriving
      late at night.  Alice, his partner, comes to the hotel first, so
      Bob wants to share his digital room key with Alice.  Bob and Alice
      are using two different mobile phones with different operating
      systems.  In order for Bob to share his digital room key to Alice
      for a weekend, he must transfer some data to her device.  The data
      structure shared between the two participants is proprietary to
      the given hotel chain (or Provisioning Entity).  This data
      transfer is a one-time, unidirectional transfer from Bob's device
      to Alice's.  Once Alice receives this data, she can provision a
      new key to her digital wallet, making a call to Provisioning
      Entity to receive new credential information.

5.  Relationships

   Intermediary actor R as Receiver S ->> I : upload credential data
   break Generic messaging channel S ->> R : send invite end Loop
   Provision credential R ->> I : request credential data I ->> R :
   deliver credential data end

6.  Assumptions

   *  User may not have the ability to revoke a credential that a
      Provisioning Entity has issued

   *  User may not have the ability to create new digital keys without
      Provisioning Entity interaction

   *  Provisioning Entity may not allow for two users to use the same
      credential / cryptographic keys.

   *  Security: Communication between Sender / Receiver and Provisioning
      Entity SHOULD be trusted.

   *  The choice of intermediary SHALL be defined by the application
      initiating the credential transfer.

   *  Sender and Receiver SHALL both be able to manage the shared
      credential at any point by communicating with the Provisioning
      Entity.  Credential lifecycle management is out of scope for this
      proposal.

   *  Any device OEM with a digital credential implementation adherent
      to Tigress [Tigress-00] SHALL be able to receive shared
      provisioning information, whether or not they can originate
      provisioning information themselves or host their own
      intermediary.

   *  Provisioning a credential on the Receiver MAY require multiple
      round trips.

7.  Requirements

   *  (Req-Connectivity) Sender and Receiver SHALL be allowed to be
      online at different times.  Sender and Receiver SHALL never need
      to be online at the same time.

   *  (Req-init) Solution SHOULD allow Sender to send the share
      invitation to Receiver over any messaging channel, with various
      degrees of security.

   *  (Req-P2P) A goal of credential transfer covered in this document
      SHALL include transfer from one device to another (group sharing
      SHALL not be a goal).

   *  (Req-Security) Solution SHOULD provide security of the
      provisioning data transferred (confidentiality, integrity and
      availability).

   *  (Req-Revoke) Solution SHALL maintain access control, allowing
      Sender to revoke before the share has been accepted, and for
      Receiver to end transfer at any time.

   *  (Req-ArbitraryFormat) The solution SHALL support arbitrary message
      formats to support both digital keys that implement public
      standards like [CCC-Digital-Key-30] as well as proprietary
      implementations of digital keys.

   *  (Req-RoundTrips) Solution SHALL allow for stateful requests
      between Sender and Receiver to support stateful actions like key
      signing requests.

   *  (Req-Preview) Solution SHOULD allow for receiver to know what is
      being added to their digital wallet.

7.1.  Intermediary server requirments

   If the solution requires an intermediary server, it should have the
   following requirements.

   *  (Req-Privacy) An Intermediary server SHALL not be able to
      correlate users between exchanges, or create a social graph.
      Intermediary server shall not be an arbiter of Identity.

   *  (Req-Notify) Solution SHOULD support a notification mechanism to
      inform devices on the content update on Intermediary server.

   *  (Req-Opaque) Message content between Sender and Receiver MUST be
      opaque to an Intermediary.

   *  (Req-IntermediaryAttestation) An Intermediary SHALL implement
      mechanisms to prevent abuse by share initiating device, verifying
      that the device is in good standing and content generated by the
      sender device can be trusted by the Intermediary.  The trust
      mechanism could be proprietary or publicly verifiable ( e.g.
      WebAuthN).

   *  (Req-ReceiverTrust) The Receiver device SHOULD be able to evaluate
      the trustworthiness of the Intermediary using a list of trusted/
      approved intermediaries.

8.  Review of existing solutions

   A number of existing solutions / protocols have been reviewed in
   order to be used for secure credential transfer based on the
   requirements: GSS-API, Kerberos, AWS S3, email, Signal.  None of the
   existing protocols comply with the requirements; the effort of
   modifying the existing protocols has been accessed to be
   significantly higher than introducing a new solution to solve this
   problem.  The goal of the Tigress draft [Tigress-00] is not to define
   a new encryption or secure message exchange protocol, but rather a
   standardized mechanism of exchanging access-specific encrypted
   credential information.

8.1.  Arbitrary Messaging Channel (Email / WhatsApp / SMS / Signal /
      etc.)

   The Provisioning Information MAY be sent from Sender to Receiver over
   an arbitrary messaging channel that supports binary file transfer,
   but this would not support provisioning flows which require multiple
   round trips as requied by (Req-RoundTrips).  The same requirement
   applies to Signal protocol outside of the Signal app, as the Req-
   RoundTrips would likely be difficult and add a lot of friction for
   the user.

8.2.  GSS-API, Kerberos

   GSS-API [RFC2078] and Kerberos [RFC4120] are authentication
   technologies which could be used to authenticate Sender, Receiver and
   intermediary.  However, as they provide strong authentication, they
   would allow the Intermediary server to build a social graph in
   violation of (Req-Privacy).  Their setup also require strong
   coordination between the actors of the system which seems overly
   costly for the intended system.  AWS S3 could be used as an
   Intermediary server but it would force all participants to use a
   specific cloud service which is in violation of (Req-AnyPlatorm).

9.  Out of Scope

   *  Identification and Authorization - solution shall not require
      strong identification and authentication from user (e.g. using PKI
      certificates).

   *  Fully stopping people from sharing malicious content ("cat
      pictures").

   *  Solving problem of sharing to groups.

   *  Detailing how credentials are provisioned either on a device or
      with a provisioning partner.
