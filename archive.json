For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(Req-SmoothUX) Solution SHALL allow for user experience where neither Sender nor Receiver is presented with\r\nraw data required only by the secure transfer protocol.

Conversely if we sent the data in binary form I could (and would presumably) present UX to the user about accepting a key and never show them the raw data. IMO these are entirely decisions for messaging apps to make that have very little to do with the underlying protocol and thus don't belong in this document. \r\n\r\nAll that said, this is probably a discussion better had in issue #7.

Both will require us to bring into scope the provisioning path with exponential growth of  complexity.

While the solution to the problem can be implemented in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, WebDAV, S3, Signal, etc, we believe that the complexity of implementation for the particular problem that we had, would be much higher if we chose other protocols. We have a problem transferring sensitive credential info between 2 mobile devices, want users of these 2 devices not to be traceable during the exchange, users to have the best and easiest possible experience, transfer to be done just between 2 particular devices. WebDav (or other alternatives fo that matter), will require a some sort of full-fledged web server (such as Apache, Nginx or other similar solution). We don't believe, that implementing a web application with just just 5 HTTP endpoints is heavier, then taking an existing WebDav implementation and updating it to address our requirements. Please feel free to disagree, but the Relay server app, as we propose, can be implemented by 1 developer in just a few weeks (depending on additional tweaks - such as integration with PushNotification servers or validation of WebAuthn) , while setting up an Apache server and extending it's functionality with manual code, just to reuse an existing web server that supports WebDav (half of which functionality we don't really need for our use case) requires a person who has deep knowledge in particular implementation.",

This document describes the problem space and the requirements for the solution the working group creates.\r\n\r\nTigress allows for a sender and receiver device to communicate in order to facilitate a secure credential transfer. Tigress also specifies certain privacy requirements in order to maintain a high level of user privacy.\r\n\r\n# General Setting\r\n\r\nWhen sharing digital secure credentials, there are several actors involved. While the Tigress working group's solution will focus on sharing information between two devices, potentially through an intermediary server, there are a couple more actors involved.\r\n\r\nThe companies that are providing the digital credential are the provisioning partners. They are in control of the provisioning information and the lifecycle of the credentials. Each device has a preexisting trust relationship between itself and the Provisioning Partner.\r\n\r\nThe interface between the devices and the Provisioning Partner can be proprietary or part of a public standard such as the CCC. The sender device obtains provisioning information from the provisioning partner, then shares it to the recipient device via Tigress. The recipient then takes that data and sends it to the Provisioning Partner to redeem a credential.\r\n\r\nFor some credential types the Provisioning Partner who mints new credentials is actually the sender device. In that scenario the receiver will generate new key material at the request of the sender device, and then communicate with the sender device over Tigress to its key material signed by the sender device.\r\n```\r\nWhat do you think about something like this? I removed the Device OEM portion and the section about the Device OEM providing a 1 to many interaction for the device.",
