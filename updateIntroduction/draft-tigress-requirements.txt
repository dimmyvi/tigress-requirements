1.  Introduction

   Today, there is no widely accepted way of transferring digital
   credentials securely between two devices belonging to the same
   platform or two different platforms.  This document describes the
   problem space and the requirements for the solution the working group
   creates.

   Tigress allows for a sender and receiver device to communicate in
   order to facilitate a secure credential transfer.  Tigress also
   specifies certain privacy requirements in order to maintain a high
   level of user privacy.

2.  General Setting

   When sharing digital secure credentials, there are several actors
   involved.  While the Tigress working group's solution will focus on
   sharing information between two devices, potentially through an
   intermediary server, there are a couple more actors involved.

   The companies that are providing the digital credential are the
   provisioning partners.  They are in control of the provisioning
   information and the lifecycle of the credentials.  Each device has a
   preexisting trust relationship between itself and the Provisioning
   Partner.

   The interface between the devices and the Provisioning Partner can be
   proprietary or part of a public standard such as the CCC.  The sender
   device obtains provisioning information from the provisioning
   partner, then shares it to the recipient device via Tigress.  The
   recipient then takes that data and sends it to the Provisioning
   Partner to redeem a credential.

   For some credential types the Provisioning Partner who mints new
   credentials is actually the sender device.  In that scenario the
   receiver will generate new key material at the request of the sender
   device, and then communicate with the sender device over Tigress to
   its key material signed by the sender device.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   General terms:

   *  Credential information - data used to authenticate the user with
      an access point.

   *  Provisioning information - data transferred from Sender to
      Receiver device that is both necessary and sufficient for the
      Receiver to request a new credential from Provisioning Partner to
      provision it to the Receiver device.

   *  Provisioning - A process of adding a new credential to the device.

   *  Provisioning Partner - an entity which facilitates Credential
      Information lifecycle on a device.  Lifecycle may include
      provisioning of credential, credential termination, credential
      update.

   *  Sender (device) - a device initiating a transfer of Provisioning
      Information to a Receiver that can provision this credential.

   *  Receiver (device) - a device that receives Provisioning
      Information and uses it to provision a new credential.

   *  Intermediary (server) - an intermediary server that provides a
      standardized and platform-independent way of transferring
      provisioning information between Sender and Receiver devices.

4.  Use Cases

   *  Let's say Ben owns a vehicle that supports digital keys which
      comply with the CCC [CCC-Digital-Key-30] open standard.  Ben would
      like to let Ryan borrow the car for the weekend.  Ryan and Ben are
      using two different mobile phones with different operating
      systems.  In order for Ben to share his car key to Ryan for a
      weekend, he must transfer some data to the receiver device.  The
      data structure shared between the two participants is defined in
      the CCC.  In addition, the CCC requires the receiver to generate
      required key material and return it to the sender to sign and
      return back to the receiver.  At this point, the receiver now has
      a token that will allow them to provision their new key with the
      car.

   *  Bob booked a room at a hotel for the weekend, but will be arriving
      late at night.  Alice, his partner, comes to the hotel first, so
      Bob wants to share his key to the room with Alice.  Bob and Alice
      are using two different mobile phones with different operating
      systems.  In order for Bob to share his key to the hotel to Alice
      for a weekend, he must transfer some data to her device.  The data
      structure shared between the two participants is proprietary to
      the given hotel chain (or Provisioning Partner).  This data
      transfer is a one-time, unidirectional from Bob's device to
      Alice's.  Once Alice receives this data, she can provision a new
      key to her device, making a call to Provisioning Partner to
      receive new credential information.

5.  Relationships

   mermaid sequenceDiagram actor S as Sender participant I as
   Intermediary actor R as Receiver S ->> I : upload credential data
   break Generic messaging channel S ->> R : send invite end Loop
   Provision credential R ->> I : request credential data I ->> R :
   deliver credential data end

6.  Assumptions

   *  Original credential information (with cryptographic key material)
      MUST NOT be sent or shared.  Instead, sender SHALL be transferring
      its approval token for Receiver to acquire new credential
      information.

   *  Provisioning Partner SHALL NOT allow for two users to use the same
      credential / cryptographic keys.

   *  Security: Communication between Sender / Receiver and Provisioning
      Partner SHOULD be trusted.

   *  The choice of intermediary SHALL be defined by the application
      initiating the credential transfer.

   *  Sender and Receiver SHALL both be able to manage the shared
      credential at any point by communicating with the Provisioning
      Partner.  Credential lifecycle management is out of scope for this
      proposal.

   *  Any device OEM with a digital credential implementation adherent
      to Tigress [Tigress-00] SHALL be able to receive shared
      provisioning information, whether or not they can originate
      provisioning information themselves or host their own
      intermediary.

   *  Provisioning a credential on the Receiver MAY require multiple
      round trips.

7.  Requirements

   *  (Req-Connectivity) Sender and Receiver SHALL be allowed to be
      online at different times.  Sender and Receiver SHALL never need
      to be online at the same time.

   *  (Req-init) Solution SHOULD allow Sender to send the share
      invitation to Receiver over any messaging channel, with various
      degrees of security.

   *  (Req-P2P) A goal of credential transfer covered in this document
      SHALL include transfer from one device to another (group sharing
      SHALL not be a goal).

   *  (Req-Security) Solution SHOULD provide security of the
      provisioning data transferred (confidentiality, integrity and
      availability).

   *  (Req-Revoke) Solution SHALL maintain access control, allowing
      Sender to revoke before the share has been accepted, and for
      Receiver to end transfer at any time.

   *  (Req-ArbitraryFormat) The solution SHALL support arbitrary message
      formats to support both keys that implement public standards like
      CCC as well as proprietary implementations of digital keys.

   *  (Req-UnderstoodFormat) Both Sender application and Receiver
      application MUST be able to recognize the format.

   *  (Req-RoundTrips) Solution SHALL allow for multiple round trips or
      multiple reads/writes between one set of Sender and Receiver
      devices.

   *  (Req-Preview) Solution SHOULD allow for extensibility and
      discoverable extensions (preview of share invitation).

   *  (Req-RedemptionHandling) Shared Provisioning Information SHOULD
      route Receiver to redeem Provisioning Information using the
      designated Credential Management Application (e.g.  Wallet).

7.1.  Intermediary server requirments

   If the solution requires an intermediary server, it should have the
   following requirements.

   *  (Req-Privacy) An Intermediary server SHALL not be able to
      correlate users between exchanges, or create a social graph.
      Intermediary server shall not be an arbiter of Identity.

   *  (Req-Notify) Solution SHOULD support a notification mechanism to
      inform devices on the content update on Intermediary server.

   *  (Req-IntermediaryProvision) An Intermediary server MUST not be
      able to provision credential on their own.

   *  (Req-Opaque) Message content between Sender and Receiver MUST be
      opaque to an Intermediary.

   *  (Req-IntermediaryAttestation) An Intermediary SHALL implement
      mechanisms to prevent abuse by share initiating device, verifying
      that the device is in good standing and content generated by the
      sender device can be trusted by the Intermediary.  The trust
      mechanism could be proprietary or publicly verifiable ( e.g.
      WebAuthN).

   *  (Req-ReceiverTrust) The Receiver device SHOULD be able to evaluate
      the trustworthiness of the Intermediary using a list of trusted/
      approved intermediaries.

8.  Review of existing solutions

   A number of existing solutions / protocols have been reviewed in
   order to be used for secure credential transfer based on the
   requirements: GSS-API, Kerberos, AWS S3, email, Signal.  None of the
   existing protocols comply with the requirements; the effort of
   modifying the existing protocols has been accessed to be
   significantly higher than introducing a new solution to solve this
   problem.  The goal of the Tigress draft [Tigress-00] is not to define
   a new encryption or secure message exchange protocol, but rather a
   standardized mechanism of exchanging access-specific encrypted
   credential information.

8.1.  Arbitrary Messaging Channel (Email / WhatsApp / SMS / Signal /
      etc.)

   The Provisioning Information MAY be sent from Sender to Receiver over
   an arbitrary messaging channel that supports binary file transfer,
   but this would not support provisioning flows which require multiple
   round trips as requied by (Req-RoundTrips).

8.2.  GSS-API, Kerberos

   GSS-API [RFC2078] and Kerberos [RFC4120] are authentication
   technologies which could be used to authenticate Sender, Receiver and
   intermediary.  However, as they provide strong authentication, they
   would allow the Intermediary server to build a social graph in
   violation of (Req-Privacy).  Their setup also require strong
   coordination between the actors of the system which seems overly
   costly for the intended system.  AWS S3 could be used as an
   Intermediary server but it would force all participants to use a
   specific cloud service which is in violation of (Req-AnyPlatorm).

8.3.  Signal Protocol

   As a messaging protocol, Signal could be used between Sender,
   Receiver and Intermediary but this protocol is fairly complex and its
   use would most like violate (Req-Simplicity).  The system will
   however support the Signal service for share initiation, in line with
   (Req-init).

9.  Out of Scope

   *  Identification and Authorization - solution shall not require
      strong identification and authentication from user (e.g. using PKI
      certificates).

   *  Fully stopping people from sharing malicious content ("cat
      pictures").

   *  Solving problem of sharing to groups.

   *  Detailing how credentials are provisioned either on a device or
      with a provisioning partner.
